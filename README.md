## mooR cowbell

This is a work-in-progress from-scratch core for `mooR`.

While some utility code might get ported from Lambda or JHCore the
intent is start from scratch to take advantage of `mooR`'s more advanced features, including:

  * Start with the web and rich content as first-class elements.
  * Use new language features like lexical scopes / blocks, symbols,
    booleans, list comprehensions, and maps.
  * Core is written using the objdef format, so can be properly
    managed and authored in revision control tools. While changes can
    be made in-MOO, they are meant to be merged back into the
    repository as the canonical version.

More doc later.
